Boxing Punch Counter ðŸ¥Š â€” This project counts punches from a boxing or shadowboxing video using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. 
It detects both left and right hand punches and displays the total punch count on the output video. 
Features include accurate punch detection using wrist and shoulder positions, a cooldown mechanism to prevent overcounting during fast movements, and saving a slower output video for better visibility. 
Requirements: Python 3.x, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and NumPy. To install the dependencies, run pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy. 
To use: rename your boxing video to boxing.mp4, place it in the same folder as the script, and run python punch_counter.py. 
The final output video with the punch counter overlay will be saved as output_punch_counter.mp4.
